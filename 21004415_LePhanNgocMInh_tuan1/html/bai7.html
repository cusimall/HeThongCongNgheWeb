        A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscle at the sides of the mouth. It is <br>
        believed it takes about 80 muscles to smile. Some smiles include a contraction of the muscle at the comer of the eyes, <br>
        an action known as a "Duchenne smile". Smile performed without the eye contraction may be perceived as insincere. <br>
